# markdown file extensions

the obvious file extension for markdown files is `.md`.

but there are multiple "flavors" of markdown, and ideally, github would render these different flavors.

at least, github should render "github flavored markdown" (gfm, ghmd), which is used in github issues/PRs/comments. test files: [test.gfm](test.gfm), [test.ghmd](test.ghmd)
